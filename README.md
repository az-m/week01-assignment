# reflection

## Targets

- Ensure each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.

Page has a <header> div containing <nav>, a <main> div containing <sections> and a <footer>.

- Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.

I used absolute positioning to put the footer link 40px from the right (although I really prefer it centered, I couldn't think of anything else to position absolutely to fulfil the condition).

- Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.

Used flex display on the header to justify title and nav to sides.

- Ensure all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths.

Only used one img in header in css. Random background image I googled and downloaded.

Added back to top link in footer and hover effect on jump links.

## Frustrations

The jump to section links don't really work properly because I can't make them respect the height of the fixed header. I've tried a few ways to make the targeted section NOT be flush with the top of the page, but nothing I tried worked. I'd be interested in a good solid workaround, which I'm happy to wait for if it's going to be covered later!

# references

I didn't Google for anything other than an image.

You might well question my use of 'this' in the JS because we haven't learned it yet. Surprisingly, I actually managed to remember it from having written a load of Vue.js a couple of years ago, all of which is available in the 'Memo' repo on my GitHub.
